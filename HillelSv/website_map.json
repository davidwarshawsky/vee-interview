Additionally, Hillel SV staff is sought out by faculty at schools without a Hillel or Jewish student group to provide support when needed on campus.\nThe campuses our Hillel serves are largely commuter-based, and many of our students hold at least one part-time job. This means that Hillel SV provides a normative college experience for students who are not in situations where it is easy to connect with a college community.\nRead MoreHILLEL OF SILICON VALLEY SERVES\nHillel SV is the only Jewish and pro-Israel organization on all five principal campuses.

If you have an account with Fidelity Charitable, Schwab Charitable, or BNY Mellon, you can use the DAF Direct box on this page.\nChoose your donor-advised fund provider and enter the amount of the gift. When you click the “Next” button, you will be taken directly to your donor advised fund provider. If your donor-advised fund provider is not listed, contact your provider directly with a request to make a grant to Hillel of Silicon Valley.\nHillel of Silicon Valley’s tax ID is 77-0575153.\nWhat is a donor-advised fund?\nA donor-advised fund (DAF) provides donors with a centralized charitable giving vehicle. It allows philanthropically inclined individuals, families, and corporations to make an irrevocable charitable gift to a public charity that sponsors a DAF program and take an immediate tax deduction.\nMain advantages of a donor-advised fund\n\nSimplicity—The DAF sponsor handles all record keeping, disbursements, and tax receipts.\nFlexibility—Timing of your tax deduction can be separate from your charitable decision making.\nTax efficiency—Contributions are tax-deductible, and any investment growth in the DAF is tax-free. It is also easy to donate long-term appreciated securities, eliminating capital gains taxes and allowing you to support several charities from one block of stock.\nFamily legacy—A DAF is a powerful way to build or continue a tradition of family philanthropy.\nNo start-up costs—There is no cost to establish a donor-advised fund. However, there are often minimum initial charitable contributions to establish the DAF (typically $5,000 or more).*\nNo transaction fees—Once approved, 100% of your recommended grant goes to your qualified public charity of choice.*\nPrivacy if desired—Donors may choose to remain anonymous to the grant recipient.\n\n* Sponsoring organizations generally assess an administrative fee on the assets in a DAF. These fees vary by the charity that sponsors a DAF program.\nThe link provided above is for convenience only, and is not an endorsement of either the linked-to entities or any products or services.\n \n \nAbout UsAbout us\nBoard of Directors\nProfessional Staff\nOur House, Directions and Hours\nContact us\n \n\nStudent LifeStudent Life\nTestimonials\nResources\nStudent Groups\nHILLEL SV NEWSLETTER Last Week’s Newsletter\n \n\nInvest in our Jewish FutureInvest in our Jewish Future\nLegacy\nShabbat Cooks and Sponsors\nOther Ways to Help\n Hillel of Silicon Valley is supported by generous community donors and, in addition, is a beneficiary of the following funders ->\n \n\nL’Dor V’DorAbout L’Dor V’Dor\nBusiness Donors\nHonorees\nSponsorship & Tribute Ad Opportunities\n Hillel International, Jewish Silicon Valley, Jewish Community Federation and Endowment Fund, Koret Foundation, Myra Reinhard Family Foundation, MZ Foundation, Seed the Dream Foundation, Milton & Sophie Meyer Charitable Fund, Davis Family Foundation, Chai House, Inc., and Oshman Family JCC Chai Giving Circle. \n \n\n \n \n \n \nToggle Sliding Bar Area\nSupport Our Students DONATE NOW\nContact Info\n\n44 S. 11th Street San Jose, CA 95112-2017\nPhone: 408-286-6669\nWeb: Contact Hillel \n\nWe take used vehicles as donations\n\r\n\tDonate Your Used Vehicles \n \n \nPage load link\nGo to Top\n",

Our staff create situations for Jewish students to interact socially, increasing the likelihood that they will meet Jewish life partners. We provide training and support for students to stand up against anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism on campuses. Additionally, we contribute to campus cultural life by presenting programs featuring Jewish/Israeli music, arts, holidays, customs and values.\nWHY HILLEL OF SILICON VALLEY IS SO SPECIAL:\nWe are a multi-campus Hillel that actively supports Jewish student groups at five local campuses and welcome any college age students in Silicon Valley no matter which school they attend. Additionally, Hillel staff is sought out by faculty at schools without a Hillel or Jewish student group to provide support when needed on campus.\nThe campuses our Hillel serves are largely commuter-based, and many of our students hold at least one part-time job. This means that Hillel provides a normative college experience for students who are not in situations where it is easy to connect with a college community.\nHillel is the first contact with the organized Jewish community for the majority of our students – students who would most likely be lost to the Jewish people if no one was actively working to connect with them.\nHillel is the only Jewish and pro-Israel organization on all five principal campuses. Hillel provides the only counter balance to anti-Israel bias and activity on campus.\nHillel is a safe space for students who don’t have money for food, need extra support for school or personal issues and need a friendly, loving adult to turn to.\nHillel_flyer_rev.pdf11.25\n \n \nAbout UsAbout us\nBoard of Directors\nProfessional Staff\nOur House, Directions and Hours\nContact us\n \n\nStudent LifeStudent Life\nTestimonials\nResources\nStudent Groups\nHILLEL SV NEWSLETTER Last Week’s Newsletter\n \n\nInvest in our Jewish FutureInvest in our Jewish Future\nLegacy\nShabbat Cooks and Sponsors\nOther Ways to Help\n Hillel of Silicon Valley is supported by generous community donors and, in addition, is a beneficiary of the following funders ->\n \n\nL’Dor V’DorAbout L’Dor V’Dor\nBusiness Donors\nHonorees\nSponsorship & Tribute Ad Opportunities\n Hillel International, Jewish Silicon Valley, Jewish Community Federation and Endowment Fund, Koret Foundation, Myra Reinhard Family Foundation, MZ Foundation, Seed the Dream Foundation, Milton & Sophie Meyer Charitable Fund, Davis Family Foundation, Chai House, Inc., and Oshman Family JCC Chai Giving Circle. \n \n\n \n \n \n \nToggle Sliding Bar Area\nSupport Our Students DONATE NOW\nContact Info\n\n44 S. 11th Street San Jose, CA 95112-2017\nPhone: 408-286-6669\nWeb: Contact Hillel \n\nWe take used vehicles as donations\n\r\n\tDonate Your Used Vehicles \n \n \nPage load link\nGo to Top\n",

Shabbat dinners are an opportunity to see old friends and meet new friends—it’s a great experience for students.\nShabbat dinners are held at Hillel SV in San Jose house every Friday night when school is in session. Students gather for a Kosher-style, home-made Shabbat dinner beginning at 6 PM. Occasionally, we offer a Kabbalat Shabbat service which begins prior to dinner (times to be announced). Throughout the year, many of our Shabbat dinners include special cultural themed foods, guest speakers, and holiday celebrations.\nIn the words of the students:\n“The food and the company are the best! I usually only miss it if I am going somewhere else for Shabbat.”\n“I think Shabbat dinners (at Hillel) are great! I don’t see a need to change anything.”\n “I like the people. It is really a homey environment.”\n“I like Hillel Shabbat dinners because you can hang with other Jews and have your weekend begin with friends.”\nIf you are interested in cooking for a Shabbat Dinner, or you would like to sponsor or co-sponsor a Shabbat dinner please contact Mitch Reitman, Assistant Director at 408-775-7532.\nJewish Holidays\nHolidays provide a wonderful tableau for connecting students with their Judaism. They are filled with traditional foods, rituals, symbolism, and meaning. Many of our students do not really understand some of the holidays and have not celebrated them in their homes. This segment of our programming elevates their Jewish literacy through informal Jewish education and increases student’s Jewish identification and involvement in Jewish communal life.\nFor each holiday we organize events that may take place on our campuses and/or at Hillel House. For events like Chanukah and Purim, we will hold celebrations at a central location on campus so that the entire campus community can be exposed to Jewish culture.\nSome of our students’ favorite holiday programs include:\nSukkot: Sukkah building and decorating, Shakshuka in the Sukkah, movie under the stars, Torah study in the Sukkah focusing on Sukkot and its traditions, Sukkot Shabbat dinner, etc.\nChanukah: Latke and sufganiyot making, Public menorah lighting, Chanukah party, toy drive, menorah making, dreidel making and playing\nTu B’Shevat: A festive Tu B’Shvat Seder featuring tree fruits and an educational component about the environment.  Students have also planned Tu B’shevat hikes.\nPassover: Every year, students and staff clean the kitchen in preparation for Pesach (Passover). Our students will often prepare food such as tasty matzah brei and matzah-lasagnas that they can enjoy during the week. We hold a beautiful Seder dinner annually at the Hillel house. We also sponsor special theme seders (e.g., interfaith, social justice) at several of our campuses.\nSocial Events\nStudents organize many types of social events for students to come together to enjoy each other’s company.  These events have included barbecues, ice cream socials, happy hours for students over the age of 21, karaoke, game nights.  The sky is the limit.\nSome of our students favorite social programs include:\nShabbaton Camping Trip: Students from all our schools are invited to gather to celebrate Shabbat outdoors at Balaban Ranch in San Jose. Together students help one another to put together their tents and help prepare dinner. Those in attendance also participate in fun interactive activities about Judaism and Israel.\nBreak Fast: After a long day of fasting for Yom Kippur, students are invited to come to Hillel to enjoy a festive dinner that may include a movie or an interactive activity.\nProfessor at the Bar: Professors from our campuses lead discussions ranging from a variety of relevant topics. Students 21 are invited to attend the program, which is held at a local restaurant or bar.\n \n \nAbout UsAbout us\nBoard of Directors\nProfessional Staff\nOur House, Directions and Hours\nContact us\n \n\nStudent LifeStudent Life\nTestimonials\nResources\nStudent Groups\nHILLEL SV NEWSLETTER Last Week’s Newsletter\n \n\nInvest in our Jewish FutureInvest in our Jewish Future\nLegacy\nShabbat Cooks and Sponsors\nOther Ways to Help\n Hillel of Silicon Valley is supported by generous community donors and, in addition, is a beneficiary of the following funders ->\n \n\nL’Dor V’DorAbout L’Dor V’Dor\nBusiness Donors\nHonorees\nSponsorship & Tribute Ad Opportunities\n Hillel International, Jewish Silicon Valley, Jewish Community Federation and Endowment Fund, Koret Foundation, Myra Reinhard Family Foundation, MZ Foundation, Seed the Dream Foundation, Milton & Sophie Meyer Charitable Fund, Davis Family Foundation, Chai House, Inc., and Oshman Family JCC Chai Giving Circle. \n \n\n \n \n \n \nToggle Sliding Bar Area\nSupport Our Students DONATE NOW\nContact Info\n\n44 S. 11th Street San Jose, CA 95112-2017\nPhone: 408-286-6669\nWeb: Contact Hillel \n\nWe take used vehicles as donations\n\r\n\tDonate Your Used Vehicles \n \n \nPage load link\nGo to Top\n",

It made me closer to my Jewish heritage and I made friends and friendships that I will cherish forever” – Shai Maor, San Jose State University 2015\n“Hillel was exactly what it says, my home away from home. I was a transfer student from Los Angeles with hardly any family in Northern California. Hillel was where I could go to feel like I was close to family. Before I came to Hillel I was considering moving back home and starting over at another college. Hillel changed me and my mind forever.”  – Hannah Booth, San Jose State University 2015\n“[Hillel of Silicon Valley] was a great social and educational outlet. I miss feeling like a part of a community and having a home away from home. A place where I was always welcome. Where I could relax and eat and learn without judgement.” – Sarah Ragent San Jose State University 2015\n“Hillel helped me build my confidence and make more friends.” – Sabina Manasherob, Foothill transfer and San Jose State University 2014\n“During my studies at SJSU I was active in Israel advocacy with Hillel, a passion which led me to pursue a graduate degree in Near East and Judaic Studies. The friendships I have made through Hillel are unshakable and I am thankful to have been able to meet so many amazing people through my involvement with this organization.” – Yael Kafri-Meiri, San Jose State University 2008\n“Hillel was a wonderful escape from school and from my other school activities I also made lifelong friends through Hillel. ” – Katie Zeisl, San Jose State University 2011\n“Hillel has had such a positive impact on me since I walked through the front door for my first Shabbat dinner. I hope future generations of college students will get to experience the same wonderful organization. The Lunch and Learn program provided the opportunity for me to learn more about Judaism in a fun and friendly way. Shabbat dinners are the best because they create an amazing sense of family and community. Hillel started my journey as a leader at SJSU. If it were not for Hillel, I would have never been President of Alpha Epsilon Pi, Vice President of Spartans for Israel, become active in the Jewish community, or even gone to Israel.’ – Eric Medeiros, San Jose State University 2012 & 2015. \nAre you an alumnus?

Would any of your friends, allow you to come over to their house in the middle of the day, just to raid their fridge, and then sleep on their couch? Would they be happy to see you do so? Would they be okay with you not paying for the food or doing your laundry there? Hillel would.”-Jordan, SJSU Student\n“I’m thankful I got the opportunity to participate in Good Deeds Day! It was a lot of fun and I believe in giving back. The preserve was really interesting and serene. Being able to give back to nature was really awesome! ” -Shana, SJSU Student\n“Hillel of Silicon Valley had helped me develop my leadership skills by giving me the tools to develop and execute my own club events. With their support the Jewish Student Union is learning how to be a thriving, self-sufficient club.” -Kylie, SJSU Student\n“Hillel puts the fun back in Judaism. Not only can I celebrate my heritage with Hillel, but I can come together with my friends and experience a new chapter in my Jewish life while surrounded by a great Jewish community.”-Spencer, SJSU Student\n“Making time to reflect on the week is important for a healthy state of mind. Good conversation, laughing, spending time with family and friends. That is Shabbat at Hillel!” -Joshua, SJSU Student\n“It’s hard to imagine life on campus without Hillel. Hillel is a community and a base unlike any other and it helps its students grow as people and as a community.” -Joseph, SJSU Student\n“Hillel is a place I feel safe and have made many lasting friendships and connections. Hillel also provided me the opportunity to travel to Israel and witness its beauty and complexity first hand. I am actively involved in advocating for Israel on campus and this is because of the efforts of our local Hillel staff.” -Justin, SJSU Student\n“I grew up in a Jewish household, but throughout high school and into college, I began to drift from my Judaism. Hillel has helped me reconnect with my Jewish roots and become actively engaged within the Jewish community.” -David, SJSU Student\n“The Birthright trip was eye opening for me in the sense that I always forget how important Israel is to other religions. It was cool that we were able to hear different sides to the conflict.”-Miriam, SJSU student\n“My growth with Judaism was not created in order to disappear when I progressed to college. Hillel gave me the opportunity to maintain my Jewish identity, endure my adversity and flourish as an individual in a safe space.”-Natalie, Foothill College Student\n“Hillel has made its own impact on my life, by providing an environment where I am always learning new things about Judaism and the people in Hillel. The support and guidance from the Hillel staff has also been helpful in the other aspect of my life.”-Daisy, Foothill College Student\n“As Elie Wiesel has said, “it is not the first time, it’s a homecoming”. That is what coming to Hillel is. Hillel provides a place of love and comfort that feels like home.”-Miriam, SJSU student\n“Hillel provides a safe space for students to be themselves and meet other students who share similar values. Without the incredible community that Hillel of Silicon Valley has created, Lauren and I wouldn’t have met”. -Ron, SJSU student\n \n \nAbout UsAbout us\nBoard of Directors\nProfessional Staff\nOur House, Directions and Hours\nContact us\n \n\nStudent LifeStudent Life\nTestimonials\nResources\nStudent Groups\nHILLEL SV NEWSLETTER Last Week’s Newsletter\n \n\nInvest in our Jewish FutureInvest in our Jewish Future\nLegacy\nShabbat Cooks and Sponsors\nOther Ways to Help\n Hillel of Silicon Valley is supported by generous community donors and, in addition, is a beneficiary of the following funders ->\n \n\nL’Dor V’DorAbout L’Dor V’Dor\nBusiness Donors\nHonorees\nSponsorship & Tribute Ad Opportunities\n Hillel International, Jewish Silicon Valley, Jewish Community Federation and Endowment Fund, Koret Foundation, Myra Reinhard Family Foundation, MZ Foundation, Seed the Dream Foundation, Milton & Sophie Meyer Charitable Fund, Davis Family Foundation, Chai House, Inc., and Oshman Family JCC Chai Giving Circle. \n \n\n \n \n \n \nToggle Sliding Bar Area\nSupport Our Students DONATE NOW\nContact Info\n\n44 S. 11th Street San Jose, CA 95112-2017\nPhone: 408-286-6669\nWeb: Contact Hillel \n\nWe take used vehicles as donations\n\r\n\tDonate Your Used Vehicles \n \n \nPage load link\nGo to Top\n",

Students from our five campuses, recent alumni, and young adults from the community gather at Hillel to celebrate their Jewish connection and enjoy a meal free of charge. We endeavor to keep all of Hillel’s programs free so as to alleviate any financial barriers to engaging with Jewish life and community.\nWe are grateful to the many community members who volunteer to cook Shabbat Dinners for the students almost every week.  The students always appreciate a home cooked Shabbat meal and we are always looking for Shabbat cooks.  Attendance at a typical Shabbat dinner is between 40-50 students.  Attendance can be much higher (50-80 students) for certain holiday celebrations, theme Shabbat dinners, and at the beginning or end of a semester.\nOur Shabbat cooks provide:\n3-4 challahs\n\nMain course\n\nSalad or soup\n\nSide dishes\n\nDessert\nIf the meal includes meat, no dairy (cheese, butter, ice cream, etc.) can be used in any of the dishes (Please check ingredient lists on packaged foods).\nIf the meal being served is dairy, no meat products can be served in any of the dishes to be served. Please consider including a vegetarian option if meat is being served (e.g. a rice dish using vegetable stock.)\n In the South Bay, Kosher Meat can be purchased in the frozen foods sections at Mollie Stones, Pars Kosher Market and Deli, Lucky-Saratoga and Trader Joes.\nPlease do not add nuts to dishes so that those allergic to tree nuts can partake.  Nuts can be provided on the side to add to salads, etc. for those who would like to enjoy them.\nHillel Provides:\nRoom Set-up\n\nWater\n\nAll of the paper and goods and plastic utensils\n\nKiddush Wine (and sometimes dinner wine)\nShabbat Dinner Sponsorship:\nAnother way that you can provide the gift of a Shabbat meal is to sponsor a meal.  A sponsorship in any amount is always appreciated.  A typical Shabbat meal can cost between $300-$500.  On special occasions (Rosh Hashanah, Chanukah, Passover, Graduation Shabbat) we like to treat the students to a catered meal which can cost between $1,000 and $1,500.\nShabbat cooks and sponsors are encouraged to join the students for Shabbat and are recognized in our annual report and in the L’Dor V’Dor tribute book.  \nFor more information or to sign up to cook or sponsor a Shabbat Dinner, please contact Mitch Reitman, Assistant Director, [email protected]; 408-775-7532.\n \n \nAbout UsAbout us\nBoard of Directors\nProfessional Staff\nOur House, Directions and Hours\nContact us\n \n\nStudent LifeStudent Life\nTestimonials\nResources\nStudent Groups\nHILLEL SV NEWSLETTER Last Week’s Newsletter\n \n\nInvest in our Jewish FutureInvest in our Jewish Future\nLegacy\nShabbat Cooks and Sponsors\nOther Ways to Help\n Hillel of Silicon Valley is supported by generous community donors and, in addition, is a beneficiary of the following funders ->\n \n\nL’Dor V’DorAbout L’Dor V’Dor\nBusiness Donors\nHonorees\nSponsorship & Tribute Ad Opportunities\n Hillel International, Jewish Silicon Valley, Jewish Community Federation and Endowment Fund, Koret Foundation, Myra Reinhard Family Foundation, MZ Foundation, Seed the Dream Foundation, Milton & Sophie Meyer Charitable Fund, Davis Family Foundation, Chai House, Inc., and Oshman Family JCC Chai Giving Circle. \n \n\n \n \n \n \nToggle Sliding Bar Area\nSupport Our Students DONATE NOW\nContact Info\n\n44 S. 11th Street San Jose, CA 95112-2017\nPhone: 408-286-6669\nWeb: Contact Hillel \n\nWe take used vehicles as donations\n\r\n\tDonate Your Used Vehicles \n \n \nPage load link\nGo to Top\n",
